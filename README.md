I have created a password generator through Javascript, its purpose is to generate a password based on the users selected criteria. Then display the password for the user.

User Story
I WANT to randomly generate a password based on my own criteria

Acceptance Criteria
WHEN I click the button to generate a password THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
